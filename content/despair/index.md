A split mechanical keyboard with one trackball on each half. The left trackball is currently set for vertical page scrolling while the right one is for normal pointing like a mouse.

This one is pre-programmed with qwerty and has additional layers for the numbers keys and symbols. Also, this has VIAL firmware so it's easy to change any keys or layers by plugging it in and going to https://vial.rocks/

All of my keyboards are designed and built by me from start to finish, apart from the PCB printing itself. I spend up to a month on each design getting it just right for the ultimate typing experience.

NOTE - MX style switches ARE included (silent linears) but the keycaps are NOT included

- QMK and VIAL firmware
- Easy to program using the interface at https://vial.rocks 
- RP2040 MCUs
- 5, or 4 columns by removing the outer columns
- Hotswap MX sockets
- 25mm POM balls for smooth rolling
