A split mechanical keyboard with one trackball on each half. The left trackball is currently set for vertical page scrolling while the right one is for normal pointing like a mouse. The key positioning is the same as the familiar Corne (crkbd). For five-column Corne users, you can remove the outer columns with the breakaway tabs.

This is my best keyboard yet! I've never used a Corne before this but now after using this board I can tell you that there is a reason it's so popular, and then to add smooth rolling trackballs to it!? This may be my endgame.

This one is pre-programmed with qwerty and has additional layers for the numbers keys and symbols.  Also, this has ZMK Studio firmware so it's easy to change any keys or layers by plugging it in and going to https://zmk.studio/

All of my keyboards are designed and built by me from start to finish, apart from the PCB printing itself. I spend up to a month on each design getting it just right for the ultimate typing experience.

- ZMK and ZMK Studio firmware
   - Easy to program using the interface at https://zmk.studio/
- Wireless pro-micro controller
- 6, 5, or 4 columns by removing the outer columns
- Hotswap MX / Choc v1 / Choc v2
- 25mm POM ball for smooth rolling
