A pseudo-split mechanical keyboard with integrated trackball. The key positioning is the same as the familiar Corne (crkbd). For five-column Corne users, you can remove the outer columns with the breakaway tabs.

This one is pre-programmed with qwerty and has additional layers for the numbers keys and symbols.  Also, this has ZMK Studio firmware so it's easy to change any keys or layers by plugging it in and going to https://zmk.studio/ 

All of my keyboards are designed and built by me from start to finish, apart from the PCB printing itself. I spend up to a month on each design getting it just right for the ultimate typing experience.

- ZMK and ZMK Studio firmware
   - Easy to program using the interface at https://zmk.studio/
- Wireless pro-micro controller
- e-ink / e-paper display
- 6, 5, or 4 columns by removing the outer columns
- Hotswap MX / Choc v1 / Choc v2
- 25mm POM ball for smooth rolling
